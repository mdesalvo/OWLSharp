# OWLSharp
This is the development branch of OWLSharp v4, a **long-term** milestone which will **rewrite the library from scratch** by following these pillars:

- Powered by **OWL2/XML**: a fluent and consistent language for modeling every ontology aspect
- Tested on **Protege**: every kind of feature will be tested in Protege
- Switch mindset: ontologists do not really think in terms of RDF, they're all domain-focused!
- Maintain good things: keep our modular validation and reasoning architecture, just adapted
- SKOS, GEO and TIME extensions will be rewritten at the end, when everything is battle-tested
