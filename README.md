# OWLSharp v4

Welcome to the development branch of OWLSharp <b>v4</b>, which is set to deliver in the next months a library <b>totally redesigned</b> on the following <b>pillars</b>:
- Based on OWL2/XML (adopting its limitless datamodel at the core)
- Built for ontologists (with OWL2 in mind, not RDF/SPARQL)
- Functionally tested on Protege (features must work with Protege before being committed)
- Scalability and performance (lessons learned from the past)
